The RNN provides a universal representation
of recurrent equations as discretized versions of the differential
equations, and therefore the update rules of its
hidden state can be interpreted as machine's understanding
of the physical laws.[25, 26]

Model Reduction with Memory and the Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems
Chao Ma, Jianchun Wang, Weinan E
(Submitted on 10 Aug 2018)
The well-known Mori-Zwanzig theory tells us that model reduction leads to memory effect. For a long time, modeling the memory effect accurately and efficiently has been an important but nearly impossible task in developing a good reduced model. In this work, we explore a natural analogy between recurrent neural networks and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to establish a systematic approach for developing reduced models with memory. Two training models-a direct training model and a dynamically coupled training model-are proposed and compared. We apply these methods to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can produce reduced model with good performance on both short-term prediction and long-term statistical properties.

Emergent Quantum Mechanics in an Introspective Machine Learning Architecture
Ce Wang, Hui Zhai, Yi-Zhuang You
(Submitted on 30 Jan 2019 (v1), last revised 5 May 2019 (this version, v3))
Can physical concepts and laws emerge in a neural network as it learns to predict the observation data of physical systems? As a benchmark and a proof-of-principle study of this possibility, here we show an introspective learning architecture that can automatically develop the concept of the quantum wave function and discover the Schrödinger equation from simulated experimental data of the potential-to-density mappings of a quantum particle. This introspective learning architecture contains a machine translator to perform the potential to density mapping, and a knowledge distiller auto-encoder to extract the essential information and its update law from the hidden states of the translator, which turns out to be the quantum wave function and the Schrödinger equation. We envision that our introspective learning architecture can enable machine learning to discover new physics in the future.
